# WordPress Simple Meeting Confirmation

Allows registered and/or non registered users to confirm if they will be
present at a planned meeting and optionally add comments and number of
participants with them.

This is a modified version of Frederic Vuong's original implementation. It is
based on version 1.8.3 that can be found here:
